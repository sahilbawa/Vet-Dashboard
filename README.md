<h1>Vet Dashboard</h1>

<p>This is a working template for an appointment dashboard interface.</p>
<h3>Available Actions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>view the list of appointments</li>
  <li>propose a new calendar time</li>
  <li>accept the calendar invites</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions are linked to empty controller actions for easy plug-and-play behavior.</p>
<p>Note: the dashboard is themed for veterinarians, but can easily be themed for any calendar dashboard. The project is already set up to use font-awesome, so it's simple to switch out the icons for any other icons.</p>
