<h1>Vet Dashboard</h1>
<a href="http://code.sahilbawa.com" target="_blank">View live example here!</a>

<p>This is a ASP.NET MVC template for an appointment dashboard interface which is already set up for integration with an API.</p>
<h3>Available Actions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>view the list of appointments</li>
  <li>propose a new calendar time</li>
  <li>accept the calendar invites</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions are linked to empty controller actions for easy plug-and-play behavior.</p>
<p>Note: the dashboard is themed for veterinarians, but can easily be themed for any calendar dashboard. The project is already set up to use font-awesome, so it's simple to switch out the icons for any other icons.</p>
